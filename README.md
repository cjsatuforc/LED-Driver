# LED Constant Current Driver Board
## LM317 Adjustable Regulator in a constant current configuration. The current value is set by the resistor value: Iout=1.25/R1. Mounting holes are tied to GND. The TO-220 package maybe soldered directly to the exposed pad to provide thermal relief for the regulator.
